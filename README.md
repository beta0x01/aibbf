## Installation

To get started with AIBBF, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/beta0x01/aibbf.git
   cd aibbf
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt # if err: use --break-system-packages
   ```
3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment for isolated dependency management.
   - Install virtualenv (If Not Already Installed)
      First, ensure that you have the virtualenv package installed. If not, install it using pip:
         ```
         pip install virtualenv
         ```
   - Clone the reposiory and navigate to `aibbf`. üÜô‚¨Ü
   - Create Virtual Environment
      - vai `virtualenv`
      ```
      virtualenv venv
      ```
      - or `venv`
      ```
      python -m venv venv
      ```
   - Activate it.
      On Linux/MacOS:
      ```
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
      On Windows:
      ```
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
   - Install Dependencies üÜô‚¨Ü
   - Deactivate the Virtual Environment (When Done)
     Once you're done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running:
      ```
      deactivate
      ```
